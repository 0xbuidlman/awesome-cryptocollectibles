## Non fungible tokens (NFTs)

_Trade (unique) collectibles on the blockchain_

Non fungible tokens (NFTs) represent ownership 
over digital or physical assets. Examples:

- Physical property -- houses, unique artwork
- Virtual collectibles -- unique pictures of kittens, collectible cards
- "Negative value" assets -- loans, burdens and other responsibilities


In general, all houses are distinct and no two kitties are alike. Non fungible tokens (NFTs) are 
*distinguishable* and must track the ownership of each one separately.



### Assets, Assets, Assets - Deeds, Deeds, Deeds - Titles, Titles, Titles

Synonyms for non fungible tokens (NFTs) in the "universe of distinguishable digital assets" include:

- deed   (descriptive for certain applications, notably, physical property).
- asset
- title
- token
- equity
- ticket



### Ethereum Request for Comments (ERC) #721

#### Unique Identifiers / IDs

Every non fungible token (NFT) is identified by a unique `uint256` ID inside the contract e.g.

``` solidity
/// @dev An array containing the Kitty struct for all Kitties in existence. The ID
///  of each cat is actually an index into this array. Note that ID 0 is a negacat,
///  the unKitty, the mythical beast that is the parent of all gen0 cats. A bizarre
///  creature that is both matron and sire... to itself! Has an invalid genetic code.
///  In other words, cat ID 0 is invalid... ;-)

Kitty[] kitties;
```

The number SHALL NOT change for the life of the contract. 
The pair (contract address, `uint256` tokenId) will then be a globally unique and fully-qualified identifier 
for a specific asset on the ethereum blockchain. 

Note: While some contracts may find it convenient to start with ID 0 and simply add one for each new token, callers SHALL NOT assume that ID numbers have any specific pattern,  and MUST treat the ID as a "black box". The choice of uint256 allows a wide variety of applications because UUIDs and SHA3 hashes are directly convertible to `uint256`.

### Buyer Beware - Here Be Dragons! - Buyer Beware

#### Q: Are crypto collectible "games" online gambling casinos?

Gambling vs Investing

> Investments are generally not considered gambling when they meet the following criteria:
>
> - Economic utility
> - Positive expected returns (at least in the long term)
> - Underlying value independent of the risk being undertaken
>
> -- [What's Gambling @ Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling)

For example, the mixing of genes when breeding (siring) new kitties is a modern
"masqueraded" or fun way to roll a dice or spin a roulette wheel.
The betting (wagering) on rare traits is a modern "masqueraded" or fun
way of betting (wagering) on lucky numbers.

And, of course, the kitties are a modern "masqueraded" or fun way of casino "funny money" tokens
rebranded as digital "virtual" cat collectibles or
non fungible tokens (NFTs).

**BEWARE: Gambling is fun and addictive. Winning and losing. Up and down.
Treat CryptoKittes (and CryptoCollectibles) as entertainment like casino gambling, sports betting or poker cards playing.
Do NOT "invest" trying to get-rich-quick
or raise the stakes trying to win back what you have lost, and so on.**


#### Q: What about scams?

**BEWARE: Yes, most crypto collectible "games" are money-grabbing get-rich-quick rip-off schemes. 
"Classic" scam examples include CryptoCelebrities, CryptoCountries, CryptoCities, Own A Number, EtherTulips and many more.**

White Paper V1  ([PDF Download](https://fishbank.io/whitepaper/FISHBANK-V1.pdf)):

**Game concept**

Player owns fishes (those are in fact ERC-721 crypto tokens) each with its unique name, image and
characteristics defined by type. Core fish parameter is weight that defines its size and influence. Main
target is to grow this parameter to become the biggest fish in the ocean.
Fish is able to gain weight only by attacking other fishes, biting off them in case of win.

The more powerful characteristics and the more weight the fish has the
more chance it to win a fight with another fish it represents.

These fishes can be traded or exchanged between players on central fish market.
Every operation in the game is launched and controlled by a contract script.

**The Fish**

Every crypto fish token has its own set of characteristics:

- Weight - Describes the size of the fish
- Power - Damage on attack
- Agility - Defense on attack
- Speed - Cooldown time before attacks

Weight is dynamic characteristic and can be changed within time while Power, Agility and
Speed are called initial parameters those are given to fish from the very moment of creation
and can't be changed in time.

**Rarity**

There are four kinds of rarity assessment  for fishes determined by sum of all
initial fish characteristics:

- Common
- Rare (10+)
- Legendary (15+)
- Epic (25+)




### CryptoTulips on the Blockchain!  (Upcoming)
