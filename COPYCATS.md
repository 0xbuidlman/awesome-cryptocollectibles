## CryptoHeroes (Hero Tavern) on the Blockchain! (Upcoming)

> Hero Tavern is a decentralized app that based on Ethereum platform. It is also a classic Simulation game. In the Game, player can acquire Heroes via many different ways. For example, Heroes can be purchased directly from the Market. Some of those Heroes are generated by System, and some are put up for sale by other players. After players own at least one Hero, they can begin journals of training and cultivating their Heroes. Every Hero has talent values; these values pretty much determine the combat power of a Hero at certain level. If players do not satisfy heroes' talent, they can wash talent. In order to have higher Combat Power, Heroes can equip better equipment or cumulate Exp to upgrade Levels. Firstly, Players can assign Heroes to fight and suppress Monsters. Players will gain weaponry of Heroes and Heroes will gain Exp. Also, there is a chance that a Hero can be rescued from Monsters. Secondly, Players can buy Treasure Maps from Auctions, then Heroes is able to go for Treasure Hunts. It is possible to meet a new Hero during the Treasure Hunt beside the chance of finding rare items. Moreover, if Players do not like or need their Heroes, and also do not want to put Heroes on Market to sale, the Factory offers Players another way to deal with their useless Heroes. By adding items, Players can recast their Heroes to generate a new one. Alternatively, Players can just simply dissolve their Heroes into items and bottles of Exp. There are more fun and more surprises for you to explore in the Game. There are more unique Heroes are waiting for you to collect. New Adventures are on the way!

from blockchaingame reddit (jan/1):

Hi everyone, I had started monitoring of cryptogames based on blockchain technology, some of games are very popular already and fun (like Cryptokitties), some will blow up market in very near future.
There types of games allow you not only have some fun, but also get some earnings (and if you are early bird that profit could be quite big).

So here we go:

Cryptokitties - pioneer in blockchain gaming. Currently has biggest auditory and market turnover per day. But since no new functionality has been added by developers(you could only breed, buy and sell), market is dropping prices each day. Hard to enter for newbies and earn something. On other hand has interesting science side to breed new cats. Honestly think it will be one of the longest projects, however it is hard earn there right now, HODLers very rare cats might win at the end of 2018(Gen0 cats will no appear). It is just very short description about project, more details coming soon.

Etheremon - one of the most potentially best blockchain games with battle mechanic(will be working from 8th Jan but is already implemented in smart contracts) and design looks like Pokemons. Started as ponzi-like scheme, but developers turned it into amazing solution as gen0 holders which might moon just in next few weeks. Those who hadn't returned their ROI received eggs which will turn into additional gen0 mons. Moreover project leader nakasatoshi has opened weekly thread about current status and seems to be very positive and hardworking guy. Personally I'm very excited about Etheremons and waiting starting trade/lease/battle functionality. Project spend 0(ZERO) dollars on marketing and have already huge community.

CryptoPets - another cool projects with solid White Paper and smart contracts which will start very soon. Early adopters are already defined(1500 persons), but still project has very big potential. I'm recommending subscribe to their channels and start playing as soon as they'll start, should be very good.

EtherTanks - currently on the stage where Etheremon was 1 week ago, ponzi-like scheme. Nothing special, design is not looks like amazing, 3d models are very poor quality(if comparing with Etheremon where developers has used (firstly without permission) amazing artworks of monsters). On other hand project exists just couple of days, so could not be rigorous too much.

Ethermon - looks like a scam, seems illegal use of Nintendo Pokemons pictures, but as far I know Nintendo are already notified about them couple days ago and nothing changed, project still exists.

Fishbank - collecting userbase via referral system. I had used mine in link and appreciate if you'll use it to register there.

CryptoPunks - strange project of Larva Labs, there is nothing to do just buy or cell one of 10000 punks.
But game already has their own auditory :)

SubPrime Crypto - upcoming project with blockchain real estate trading

Cryptopuppies - another pet adoption game, will be released in near future, seems to be much more cuter than Cryptokitties.

CryptoFighters - interesting and potentially very attractive project, join now to have possibility win gen0 fighters which might have some good value quite soon.

HashPupies - currently only one based not on ETH network, but on NEO.

EtherRock - totally strange project, similar to Punks but only 100 rocks.

Cryptodrome - interesting project, will be starting very soon, now with Horses

Parsec Frontiers - totally another topic of blockchain but seems very perspective - space economic strategy, ICO has not been started, so if you're interested, try to rush into whitelist.

*** NEW ***

Decentraland - not a game originally but based on their own cryptocurrency MANA and will join blockchain with AR

Nova Blitz - potentially one of the hugest TCG on blockchain. They're are starting initial coin sell in couple of hours. Whitepaper looks very solid at least right now. Only one project with user agreement during buying tokens.

Descriptions will be added later as well as offiicial reddit pages, discord and telegram channels, and other interesting stuff.
